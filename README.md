# Einstein-s-Riddle

Hello there! Do you know the Einstein's Riddle? This is an interesting and challenging problem that you can find around the web. You can check its description here (https://udel.edu/~os/riddle.html) and try to solve it by your own here (https://rachacuca.com.br/teste-de-einstein/ - avaible in Portuguese).

This is a very cool project I worked on during the Programming Paradigm course at the University of Campinas. It was developed in the Prolog language (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prolog), using the SWI-Prolog implementation (http://www.swi-prolog.org/Download.html). This project consists of a Prolog programm that is able to solve the Eintein's Riddle! But not only this one, in fact, any riddle of this kind!

You can check in the next sections further details on the implementation of the solution, how to run it and how to create your on riddle input files.
